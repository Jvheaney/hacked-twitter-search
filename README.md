# hacked-twitter-search
A single line hacky solution to tokenize "from:" in the Twitter search bar.

This is a _very_ hacky solution to tokenize "from:" in the search bar. It has to be paired up with the proper request to the backend, but visually it looks good. The first time it tokenizes has a bit of a "jerk", this is probably something buried in the frontend code. I added a timeout to remove it again. Only needed on the first time.

This would work much better if I was working on the source code, btw :)
